first of all we have setup following things:
1. Database
2. Template location
3. Static file location

lets begin from Database
Database setup already done

next about Template
done

next Static file location
look carefully

i want to  open this link for copy static settings

there is two types of file  setting 
first, static dir wich put in setting.py  ==> done

and another root static ==> done
which is put in the url 
copy from the same link  or page 

Next we have test by run our project 
it's working or not ?


Before testing we setup about it index page from view and url
it's work but not  work javascript and css lets 
fixed this problem
Before that we  have manage all template files in proper way
like css , fonts , js  and images
these are all move to static


lets purify the index page for working  css and javascript
suna hai yo chai ma milauxu {% static wala k hai} yo milya pxe template run hunxa

hunxa timi hera  huss
roka la ma khana khanxu



look carefully there no loaded static 




you have to slicing this  template
like  header , footer etc

i think , you can it 

lets check how much pic are not  loaded at your index page
only two images left to maintain static one  ico then another  logo
not differented 

slicing garna saknu hunxa kin dekhai dinu parxa ???
